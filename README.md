# Overview

This web app is a font picker, as well as a color picker. You start it up by running npm run-build.

My purpose for this software was to learn about React, and also to learn about user interaction and having that interaction change other elements on the UI.

# Web Pages

For this page, I have two different user interactions. One is an input, where if a user writes text, then that text will be displayed in all of the fonts. The other is a color picker, where if a color is chosen, all of the fonts will be shown in that color.
# Development Environment

For this project I used react, as well as yarn and vite.

# Future Work

* I want to be able to clear the colors
* I want the colors to be shown at all times and not just when being selected
* I think it would be cool to have a color picker with the full gradient instead of a finite number of options.
